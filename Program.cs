/*You need to create a Math game containing the 4 basic operations
** create methods that will execute operations for + - * / **

The divisions should result on INTEGERS ONLY and dividends should go 
from 0 to 100. Example: Your app shouldn't present the division 7/2 
to the user, since it doesn't result in an integer.
** build a method that validates proper division for the app **

Users should be presented with a menu to choose an operation
** build a menu for the user to interact with**

You should record previous games in a List and there should be an 
option in the menu for the user to visualize a history of previous games
**build another method that stores previous games in a list**

You don't need to record results on a database. Once the program
 is closed the results will be deleted.

 projects
